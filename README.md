📝 My TODO App

My TODO App is a lightweight yet powerful task management tool built with React (Vite) and styled using Tailwind CSS. It helps users stay organized by allowing them to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete. All data is stored in the browser using localStorage, so your tasks remain even after refreshing or reopening the app.

🌟 Features

✅ Add Tasks – Type in your tasks and hit Enter or click Save to add them.

📝 Edit Tasks – Modify existing tasks easily with one click.

🗑️ Delete Tasks – Remove tasks when you're done with them.

☑️ Mark Complete/Incomplete – Check off tasks as you complete them.

🔁 Persistent Storage – Your data is saved in localStorage so nothing is lost.

⚛️ React Hooks – Built using functional components and React hooks (useState, useEffect).

🎨 Tailwind CSS – Clean, responsive, and modern design with Tailwind.

💡 UUID Support – Every task gets a unique ID using the uuid package.
